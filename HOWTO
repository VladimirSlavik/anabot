Disclaimer:
Currently, it is possible only to start GUI test manually.
The code is only in proof of concept stage right now.

Prepare updates.img with test:
$ ./make_updates.sh ~/public_html/dogtail.img

Start anaconda with prepared anabot.img:
append on kernel cmdline:
updates=http://myhost.example.com/~myuser/anabot.img graphical console=tty0 console=ttyS0

Anabot is started automatically via systemd. You can observe output of anabot using journalctl:
 * $ journalctl -fu anabot-prepare
 * $ journalctl -fu anabot

If something went wrong, you can still put manually anaconda to desired state via GUI and then prepare again updates.img on your system:
$ ./make_updates.sh ~/public_html/anabot.img
Then on serial console of system run:
$ ./get_update.sh
And start anabot:
$ ./start-anabot.py


It's currently not possible to specify or fetch test description (xml) from any other location then updates.img.
If you want, it's just few lines of code and pull requests are welcome.
